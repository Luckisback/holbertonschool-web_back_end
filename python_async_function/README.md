## Asynchrone 


At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* Async and await syntax
* How to execute an async program with asynciosignatures and variable types
* How to run concurrent coroutines
* How to create asyncio tasks
* How to use the random module



## `Requirements`

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
    Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)



### Tasks

0. The basics of async 
1. Let's execute multiple coroutines at the same time with async 
2. Measure the runtime  
3. Tasks
4. Tasks
